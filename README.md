# Pig-Game

Pig-Game implementation on Javascript as an exercise task from the
Jonas Schmedtmann course: The Complete JavaScript Course 2020: Build Real Projects!

The game is started with the index.html file. Open it with your favourite
browser (preferably Google Chrome).

Rules:

(1) Each time you row the dices your current score is increased with the ammount
you rowed.
(2) You can press hold which will add your current score to your permanent score.
(3) If you row same digits on both dices you loose your current score,
player 2 begins his turn.
(4) Permanent score is not affected by rule (3).
(5) The first person who hits 100 on the permanent score wins.
