The game is started with the index.html file. Open it with your favourite
browser (preferably Google Chrome).

Rules:

(1) Each time you row the dices your current score is increased with the ammount
you rowed. <br />
(2) You can press hold which will add your current score to your permanent score. <br />
(3) If you row same digits on both dices you loose your current score,
player 2 begins his turn. <br />
(4) Permanent score is not affected by rule (3). <br />
(5) The first person who hits 100 on the permanent score wins. <br />
